                    <p>
                        Master's student at MIT with a concentration in Computer Systems (concurrently finishing undergrad in Computer Science so as to receive both degrees in 4.5 years). Currently doing research in MIT's compiler group under Professor Saman Amarasinghe. Interested in high-performance computing, compilers, novel computation architectures, and distributed systems. Have significant programming experience and multiple successful published apps with several million downloads.
                        <br>
                        <br> I started programming in 3rd grade with simple games built in C#. I slowly built up my programming skills by reading books and using online resources. Right before entering high school, I switched to an Android phone and quickly learned how easy and useful it was to build Android apps. Throughout high school, I built successively more complex apps and quickly learned how writing software allowed me to impact the lives of millions of users. I consider my ability to learn new concepts and technologies quickly to be my greatest strength.
                        <br>
                        <br> I started MIT with a deep fascination for Artificial Intelligence with a special interest in what AI can learn from neuroscience. However, I became frustrated with the lack of theory (especially in Applied ML) and found my systems classes to be much more fulfilling. I love solving problems in highly-constrained environments such as on novel computation architectures, within a distributed system, or when high-performance is essential. I live for those moments of flow when you are working on a difficult problem with the right team.

                            Created a dataset of 373,521 images and trained a captioning neural network to allow for fine-tuned captioning of clothing images (performing substantially better than existing models).

                            As show in the the Black Mirror episode “Nosedive”, online reputation systems have the potential to be extremely powerful and dangerous. We believe that online reputation systems are inevitable. However we believe that if such a system is ultimately going to exist, it should be decentralized, rather than being controlled by private corporations or governments. We wanted to see how such a system would look like and operate, so we developed a distributed reputation app using Android, Ethereum blockchain, and the Eigentrust algorithm.

                            <b>Facebook Global Hackathon Finalist and Top 8, Best Facebook Hack YHacks at Yale University</b>
                            <br> Once you've talked to a person for a certain amount of time, SocialEyes recognizes and stores their face on the Android app. It groups those faces by person and you then have the ability to connect their face to their Facebook account. From then on, whenever you encounter that person, SocialEyes tracks and recognizes the face and brings up his or her information in a HUD environment. SocialEyes can even tell you the persons heart rate as you are talking to them. Built with Logan Engstrom, Michael Shumikhin, and Logan Taylor.

                            <b>2nd Place in Crowd Vote and Best AR Hack TreeHacks at Stanford University</b>
                            <br> We hacked Android to access the screen, live broadcast it, as well as control the touchscreen via code! We used firebase as a realtime update mechanism for storing our data, which proved to be challenging as Unity does not have a library for firebase. We hacked together our own Unity firebase library in order to turn the vision into reality. Using certain linux commands, we were able to output the screen's buffer into a png file, which we read back, resized, and uploaded to firebase as a base 64 String. We relayed touch coordinates that simulated taps on the touchscreen via linux commands that simulate touchscreen input. Built with Mohammad Adib and Andrew Nguyen.

                        <p>

                            <br> Problem: GPS's are super useful even when you know how to get from point A to point B because they will route you away from traffic. But it is a pain to have to start the gps every time you get in the car. It also drains your battery and forces you to listen to directions you already know. 
                            <br>
                            Solution: Use gps, wifi, and accelerometer data to detect when you are driving. Then perform analysis on the possible routes (using Bing Maps API) to determine if you are attempting to drive home and if you are taking the optimal route. Once it detects you are driving it will periodically check if your preferred route is still the fastest. If there is a better route it will let you know and ask if you wish to start navigation.
